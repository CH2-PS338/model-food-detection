# Food Detection Machine Learning Model Readme

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for food detection using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to identify and classify different types of food items. The project also utilizes Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and the OS module for file system operations.

## Technologies Used

1. **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework developed by the TensorFlow team at Google.

2. **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.

3. **Pandas**: A data manipulation library for Python, providing data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets.

4. **Matplotlib**: A 2D plotting library for Python, used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

5. **OS module**: A Python module that provides a way to interact with the operating system, allowing file system operations.
